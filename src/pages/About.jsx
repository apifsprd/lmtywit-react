        LMTYWIT stands for Let Me Tell You What I Think, starting from a reading
        into an anxiety to want to write and tell everything that I think is
        interesting to discuss, trying to have an opinion on the events that
        happened. It all started with the anxiety of trying to give a personal
        perspective. as the name implies, "Let Me Tell You What I Think",
        welcome and thank you for visiting my personal blog, hopefully it will
        give you a new perspective.
